# CP-SPCA
Cardinality penalty sparse PCA

### Methods to compare: 
CP-SPCA(our), gpower, spca, rsvd-spca. 

### Simulation set up:
- 1 component.
- Shen and Huang 2008 (see gpower simulation)
- Check for: Correlation with the population w, correct classification of sparsity.
### Practicla example(s):
- Trade off curve: using real data set! 
- ultra HDs

### [Optional] 
Thinkg about adding a creating a Shiny app for this paper considering the journal.
